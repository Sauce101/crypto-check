### A real-time crypto app
 
By: Michael Saucedo - cs50W 2020

## Why is Cryptocurrency Important? 
There is a reason why cryptocurrencies have become so popular. They do make it very convenient to transfer funds between two parties. There is no need for a third party or a middleman. Also, the processing charges are low compared to the traditional charges levied by banks or other financial institutions. one other key item to note is that as cryptocurrencies become more widespread, it is really the decentralised ledger technology, blockchain, upon which crypto is based, which is the true masterpiece.

Also, as an aside, digital currency such as Bitcoin should not result in inflation. The total number of bitcoins which can ever be mined is limited to approximately 21 million, so there is no way the total amount of cash in the system can be increased by any central bank. Bitcoin itself is, by its nature, scarce… though one can certainly argue that cryptocurrencies themselves, are infinite as they can be generated by anyone.

## Self updating cryptocurrency checker
**Project idea** – I wanted to make a crypto app that checks the stats and positions of cryptocurrency in real time. The client orders what job needs to be done to the message broker (Redis). Next the message broker takes the message out of the que and delivers it to the worker (Celery) in order to execute this given task. This is done *outside* the request - response cycle we are all used to in Django. 

Originally I was going to install Django Channels and use asgi to handle connections in asynchronous style to update the frontend from what the Celery tasks was doing to update the database. Then in the middle of all of this I remembered hey, the black box (Doug Lloyd), just use some Ajax. So Celery for the backend and an Ajax chain for real-time frontend using the same API as the backend.

## [Coin Gecko - API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)

**Coin Gecko** - API for tasks.py (backend) & views.py (frontend)
```js
url = 'https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=100&page=1&sparkline=false'
```

## [Celery - Distributed Task Queue (Django)](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/django/index.html)

**Celery** is an asynchronous task queue based on distributed message passing. It provides functionalities to run real-time operations and schedule some tasks to be executed later. These tasks can be executed asynchronous or synchronous, this means you may prefer to run them at the background or chain them to make one task to be fulfilled after the successful execution of an another task. Client to Broker (**Redis**) to Worker. The celerybeat service enables you to schedule tasks to run at intervals.

## [What is Redis and why use it?](https://redis.io/)
**Redis** (REmote DIctionary Server), is an in-memory data structure store that can be utilized as a database, cache, or a message broker. For instance, Twitter stores the most recent incoming tweets for a user on Redis to speed up the delivery of the tweets to client applications.

## To run frontend only:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
## To run backend in addition to frontend:
Celery beat code in a seperate terminal
```
celery -A crypto beat -l info
```

Celery worker code in another seperate terminal
```
celery -A crypto worker -l info
```
